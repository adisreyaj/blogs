If you are not a DevOps person, deploying applications is not going to be very easy if you are trying to do everything on your own. This is the primary reason we have a lot of managed offerings from companies like Heroku, Vercel, Fly etc.

Managed offerings make it extremely easy to deploy applications on the Internet. They eliminate the hassle for us, but this convenience comes at a cost. Recently there has been a lot of noise around the self-hosting vs managed hosting.

### My VPS configuration

I've been hosting all my APIs for applications like Flagsy, Flare, Compito, etc on a VPS with the following configuration:

1. 1 vCPU
    
2. 2GB RAM
    
3. 40GB Storage
    
4. Ubuntu
    

Worked well for my use case. The VPS cost me around $7 per month. I've now shifted to a new VPS from Oracle which provides a great config in their free tier.

1. 4 vCPU
    
2. 24GB RAM
    
3. ARM Based
    
4. Ubuntu
    

## Deployment workflow before Coolify

For all these years, I've been using GitHub Actions with a custom workflow for deploying applications to the server. The GitHub Action workflow is as follows:

1. Build the Application.
    
2. Package the contents into an artifact (`.tar` file).
    
3. Send the artifact to the remote server using `rsync` (ref: [How to use Rsync to Sync Local and Remote Directories](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rsync-to-sync-local-and-remote-directories)**)**
    
4. SSH into the remote server.
    
5. Extract the contents of the `.tar` file.
    
6. Install Dependencies.
    
7. Run the application using PM2 (ref: [Process manager for Node.js](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/))
    

## Deployment using Coolify

When I came across Coolify, I thought of giving it a try. I am aware of [Dokku](https://dokku.com), but I never really tried it because it doesn't have a UI. I work primarily as a UI developer, so having a nice UI to work with is a plus for me.

Coolify is an open source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative. Built by [Andras Bacsai (@heyandras)](https://twitter.com/heyandras)

It's surprisingly good. I did feel a bit lost when I first started trying it out. Eventually, everything fell into place, and I've moved all my previously hosted node applications to use Coolify instead.

## Getting started with Coolify

To get started, you need a server, it can be a VPS, a Raspberry Pi, or any other server that you have SSH access to.

Coolify comes with a pretty neat one-click installation script which makes the installation super easy.

### **Minimum requirements for Coolify**

* 2 CPUs
    
* 2 GB memory
    
* 30+ GB of storage for the images.
    

VPS offerings that I found to be good:

* Hetzner
    
* OVH
    

I've used both of these and didn't have any issues with them.

## Installing Coolify

The first step is to SSH into your server.

```bash
ssh <username>@<ip_address>
```

Once you are inside the VPS. Enter the below command to install Coolify

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

If you get an error saying: `Please run as root` using the command below:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Once the installation is complete, you'll get a link to the Coolify dashboard. When you visit the link (Eg: `http://<server_ip>:8000`), you'll be asked to register yourself.

### Localhost vs Remote Server

On completion of registration, we will come to this screen where we need to choose whether we want everything to be on one server or not.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">If you want to host Coolify on one server and deploy the applications on a different one, go with the <strong>Remote Server</strong> option. Else continue with <strong>Localhost</strong>.</div>
</div>

I am using the Localhost mode. In the next step, server requirements are validated. Once validation is complete, we can get started by creating our first project.

### Resources

We can host multiple resources in the server like **Applications**, **Databases** and **Services**. Each of these are called as a resource in Coolify.

Coolify supports deployment of applications from your private GitHub repo or any public repo. You can also deploy using Docker.

When it comes to databases, we have out of the box support for popular databases like **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **Mongo**, **Redis** etc.

## Deploy Node application using Coolify

There are couple of ways in which we can deploy a node.js application. We will be looking at how to deploy a node application on Coolify using **Nixpacks**.

### Deploy using Nixpacks

This one will be the easiest way to deploy any node application using Coolify. The whole process is pretty straight forward.

> Nixpacks takes a source directory and produces an OCI compliant image that can be deployed anywhere.

In simpler terms, [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs) will analyse the source folder and automatically create a **Dockerfile** for us. We don't have to know anything about docker.

We are going to be building a super simple Notes API using:

* [Hono - Ultrafast web framework for the Edges](https://hono.dev)
    
* TypeScript
    
* MySQL
    

### Setting up the MySQL database

Under **Project** &gt; **Environment** &gt; **Resources** &gt; + **New** &gt; **Databases**, you'll be able to see **MySQL**. Start by adding a database into your project.

All the necessary information is prefilled, and we are good to go. Clicking on **Start** will spin up a docker container. Wait for the process to complete and once done, the status would say **Running**.

### Deploying The Node Application

For deploying our node application, we start by adding a new resource to your project by going to **Project** &gt; **Environment** &gt; **Resources** &gt; **\+ New &gt; Public Repository**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713451098836/17d9ad79-96d4-44f1-ba62-a066ba167e22.png align="center")

Continue till we are asked to provide the URL of the repo:

```http
https://github.com/adisreyaj/notes-api
```

Once Coolify loads the repo, we'll be asked to create a new application. We choose **Nixpacks** as the Build Pack and use `3000` for the port to run the app on.

#### Configure environment variables!

We need to configure the environment variables that are consumed by our application. Navigate the **Environment Variables** page and start adding the following variables.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸš¨</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">If you are using <strong>Prisma</strong>, we need to expose the database to the internet. Some applications / libraries need to connect to the database during the build phase, to run migrations for example. Ref: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/faq#database" style="pointer-events: none">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) with Coolify</a></div>
</div>

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713453665389/8ceb7f4f-5c87-4dec-a64c-666e90ea8615.png align="center")

Copy the **MySQL URL(Public)** in case you are using **Prisma** or copy the **MySQL URL(Internal)** URL in other cases.

```markdown
mysql://mysql:BfwAmHtmTokbm70fUoFcsL7obNMPCFcW@vww348go4:3306/default
```

We can split the database URL into the below environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_HOST=vww348go4
DATABASE_NAME=default
DATABASE_PASSWORD=BfwAmHtmTokbm70fUoFcsL7obNMPCFcW
DATABASE_PORT=3306
DATABASE_USER=mysql
PORT=3000
```

You can either add all of these variables at once using **Developer View** or create them individually.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713452045363/e019373a-2e6d-4b3b-b6ec-e49913fd3dbe.png align="center")

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">â„¹</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">There is an option called <strong>Build Variable</strong> which will make the env available during build phase. For this particular example, we don't need to check the option. But for <strong>Prisma</strong> and other libraries, we need to make the environment variables accessible at build time.</div>
</div>

#### Deploy the application!

Once we have configured the env variables, we can go ahead a **Deploy** the application. Coolify shows the logs of the process, we can click on **Show Debug Logs** to see detailed logs.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713452431902/2d9f6970-8ecd-449d-bd9b-1c98bc4232be.png align="center")

Once the application is deployed successfully, we can view the logs of the application under the **Logs** tab.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713452583052/401e1970-e6c6-42d5-9fe0-0518f9b71fc3.png align="center")

You should be able to visit the domain provided and see the app live.

### Troubleshooting

#### Providing custom commands

If you think that **Nixpacks** picked wrong commands for install, build, or start, you can customize it in the **Configuration &gt; General** section.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713453094419/523ce239-c945-4ebe-ae31-b08a4805b05a.png align="center")

#### Database not reachable

If you see any errors related to database not reachable, make sure to double check the env variables and make sure they are correct.

Also, if you are using **Prisma** or other libraries which might access database at build time, make sure to mark the environment variables as **Build Variable**.

For **Prisma** with **Nixpacks**, we need to make the database publicly accessible over the internet.
